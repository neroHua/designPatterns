/**
 *  adapter vs bridge vs facade
 *      adapter: two interface and new one reuse part of old one
 *      bridge: one interface and its implementations vary independent
 *      facade: one new interface cover other interfaces
 *
 *  composite vs decorator vs proxy
 *      composite: different components into tree or table and client use them uniformly.
 *      decorator: dynamic add responsibilities to components without subclassing
 *      proxy: control object access
